# FOCS CYK Algorithm 

The `cyk.py` file contains a simple implementation of the CYK algorithm for a predefined ruleset defined in the Chomsky Normal Form. The code can be ran with `python3 cyk.py` and does not require any depedencies. The ruleset and test word can be updated at the top of the script.
